In UNDER_TEST mode, meant to be run in a PC, hardware is
simulated as follows:

1) File gpiomcpr.sim is read as an integer number. Bits 0-5 are
   level sensors, bits 6 and 7 are the manual switches.

2) Flow meter pulses are simulated by writing a number 
   in pulses.sim. The file is removed as the test program
   fetches the value. Write the number of pulses once a
   second, to make sure test.cpp has time to eval it.

3) Pump output bit is simulated by writing to gpiomcpw.sim.

4) For instrumentation, the internal state is written to
   state.sim. Rows:
   * state (string as defined in State::name())
   * level in %, float, w/o %
   * level in L, float, w/o unit
   * flow rate in L/min, float, w/o unit
   	(one row per averaging timespan)
   * "E" if detected failure in level sensor

5) If file quit.sim is found, it is removed and test exits.
