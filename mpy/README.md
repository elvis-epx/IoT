# MicroPython automation projects

This is a personal project for home automation written in MicroPython. At the moment,
it has no intention of becoming the next Tasmota or ESPHome. It is directed to the
devices I have, documentation is lacking and it is not very configurable.

Nevertheless, it is written and maintained to be very reliable, so it could be useful
as reference for people starting at MicroPython, or trying to interface with some
device similar to those we use. I plan to add more documentation for every module
as possible.
