- MicroPython OTA
    - More tests

- Uptime with random factor, possibly all MQTT periodic topics

- Improve system logging, use ota.log_pub for all print()s or use another protocol
- Remote mpy console, if possible
- MQTT with TLS
- ESP-NOW
    - fixing channel in central device does not work
           (it follows the AP it connects to which may NOT be the nearest one)
    - increase test coverage
        - espnow mock
            - use socketpair() to satisfy poll()
            - exchange packets using files
        - create separate tool to send/receive packets as files
