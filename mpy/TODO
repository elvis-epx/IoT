- Recovery from exceptions or bad code OTA updates
    - Remote mpy console, if possible
- MQTT with TLS
- ESP-NOW
    - Use WT32-ETH01 (with wired LAN) as gateway
        (resolves problems with AP channel, see next item)
        - Add LAN chip configuration in config.txt
    - OTA update vs ESP-NOW vs gateway?
        - Pass through gateway x bring up Wi-Fi for OTA
    - fixing channel in central device does not work
           (it follows the AP it connects to which may NOT be the nearest one)
    - increase test coverage
        - espnow mock
            - use socketpair() to satisfy poll()
            - exchange packets using files
        - create separate tool to send/receive packets as files
