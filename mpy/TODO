- OSError EIO exception in event loop poll() - investigate
    - EIO expected?
    - Is socket being polled when it is already invalid?
        - No pathway suggests this
    - Try to determine conditions where OSError EIO is raised
    - Mitigations (difficult but not impossible if polling >1 object)
    - See if it still happens with new mqtt publish
- ESP-NOW
    - fixing channel in central device does not work
           (it follows the AP it connects to which may NOT be the nearest one)
    - increase test coverage
- MQTT with TLS
- MicroPython OTA
- Remote mpy console, if possible
