    - EIO expected?
    - Is socket being polled when it is already invalid?
    - no run path found that could lead to this
- ESP-NOW
    - fixing channel in central device does not work
           (it follows the AP it connects to which may NOT be the nearest one)

- MQTT with TLS
- MicroPython OTA
- Remote mpy console, if possible
