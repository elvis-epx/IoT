- ESP-NOW
    - fixing channel in central device does not work
           (it follows the AP it connects to which may NOT be the nearest one)
    - encryption using PSK
    - irq() vs polling - more tests

Roadmap
=======

- OTA commit all or nothing
- MicroPython OTA
- MQTT with TLS
- MQTT w/o blocking points (move poll() into event loop)
- Replace polling by IRQs, callbacks, etc.
- Remote mpy console, if possible
