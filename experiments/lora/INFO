Based on https://github.com/reillybeacom/uPyLora.git and https://github.com/sergio303/micropython-sx127x

Reed-Solomon module from https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/reedsolomon.git

Good results with SF9 62.5kHz for indoor LoRa (masonry house) and big backyard
    could go with SF9 125kHz or faster if antenna better positioned (attic)

Suggested protocol: 
    type: 0.5 or 1 byte
    topic: 1.5..2.5 bytes 
    seq: 1 byte
    payload
    FEC: 4 bytes
